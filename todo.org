* Development
** TODO Consider adding support for `unfactor` function, which handles numerics/
   integers the way we would expect.
** TODO Let the user determine which columns to factorize.
** TODO Make some optional packages required, to make downstream dependencies
   less likely to run into package issues: BiocFileCache, readr, data.table.
** TODO Add code coverage for BAM, CRAM, SAM, BCF, and VCF files.
** TODO Need to improve export of matrix with row names defined.
    Currently dropping this...add code coverage.
** TODO File path messages are inconsistent on Windows?
** TODO Some of the unit tests are failing on Windows?
