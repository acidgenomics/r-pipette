* Development
** TODO File path messages are inconsistent on Windows.
** TODO Some of the unit tests are failing on Windows.
    Need to get a laptop with Windows 11 and fix these.
** TODO Add support for OBO file (e.g. Cellosaurus) using BiocSet.
** TODO `import()`: Check that we have a `tryCatch()` call for invalid YAML that will stop on warnings.
** TODO Do we need to improve sanitization of BiocFileCache local file names
   for complex URLs?
   For example:
   /Users/mike/.cache/R/DepMapAnalysis/
       147524e053f4a_top_correlations%3Fdataset_name%3DRNAi_merged
** TODO Test support for readr v2.0.0 update.
** TODO Need to improve support for fixed width file (FWF) parsing?
** TODO importMTX: MTX import: look for "barcodes.tsv.gz", "genes.tsv.gz",
   "features.tsv.gz", which are output by CellRanger.
** TODO Add `sanitizePercentage()` function?
