* Development
** TODO Evaluate adding support for reading files directly from S3.
    Should we use paws package for this?
** TODO Can we add support for `append = TRUE` of lines using base engine?
    Maybe we can load the vector into memory, add at the end, and then write to disk.
** TODO Add support for export of DelayedArray objects, such as DelayedMatrix.
** TODO Export class support ideas.
    SplitDFrameList, DFrameList, List, list.
** TODO Rework the title. CRAN warning:
    Pipette Biological Data in and Out of R
** TODO Need to improve export of matrix with row names defined.
    Currently dropping this?
** TODO Let the user determine which columns to factorize.
** TODO Remove factorize calls in other packages in favor of Rle.
    Alternatively, pick the columns to factorize.
** TODO Add code coverage for BAM, CRAM, SAM, BCF, and VCF files.
** TODO Need to check package coverage on Windows.
** TODO Check that file path messages work on Windows.
